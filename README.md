## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project in your local development environment.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >=18.18.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A PostgreSQL database instance.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env.local` and fill it with your own credentials.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open the `.env.local` file and replace the placeholder values. **NEVER commit your `.env.local` file to Git!**

### 5. Set Up the Database

Run the Prisma migrations to create the necessary tables in your database, then seed it with initial data (admin user, categories, etc.).

```bash
# Generate the Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Apply migrations to the database
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database with initial data
npm run prisma:seed
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
